                are just
                <br>looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of <br>attention, settling for something much less than respect. I <br>am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship <br>grow is by showing respect.

                <p class="p4">I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be <br>respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone <br>extra special attention, high regard, based on a desire to <br>show them how highly they are valued.</p>
