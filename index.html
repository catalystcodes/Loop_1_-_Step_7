                <b>T</b>hedesire to be respected by someone of the opposite <br>sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even <br>though most people don't take the time to find someone <br> who truly respect them. It seems like people are just
                <br>looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of <br>attention, settling for something much less than respect. I <br>am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship <br>grow is by showing respect.
